# World 6

World executes complete Boundary programs through one Zig interpreter, built
natively and as an import-free wasm32 kernel. Computations, handlers, policies,
retained control and cleanup are program data. The environment supplies typed
external results.

World `6.0.0` supports only exact Zig `0.17.0` and Boundary 3 data.
It consumes BPI3 programs and PST3 states through ABI 3. See the
[ABI contract](docs/kernel-abi.md) and [verification boundaries](docs/verification.md).
Current source/package identities are selected by the consuming lock; published
release bytes remain unchanged.

## JavaScript and browser Workers

The package root is an environment-neutral byte API:

```js
import { Kernel, encodeInput, decodeOutcome, decodeRequest, encodeResult } from "@tkersey/world";
const kernel = await Kernel.create({ bytes: kernelBytes, expectedSha256 });
const outcome = decodeOutcome(kernel.invoke(encodeInput({ image, initialArgs })));
if (outcome.kind === "requested") {
  const request = await decodeRequest(outcome.request);
  // Resolve the declared operation using the environment's permitted adapter.
  const value = await encodeResult(outcome.request, typedReplyBytes);
  const next = decodeOutcome(kernel.invoke(encodeInput({ image, state: outcome.state, control: "reply", value })));
}
```

Supply expected kernel identity from the consuming application's trusted binding.
The same entry point loads directly in a real browser Worker without Node imports
or a bundler. Inputs and returned buffers have explicit ownership; old image,
checkpoint and envelope families reject.

`prepare`, `start`/`restore`, `drive`, `checkpoint`, `close`, and
`releasePrepared` expose prepared/resident execution through the same evaluator.
Resident checkpoints are explicit; `checkpoint(session, { transfer: true })`
exports and releases only after successful output publication. `close` requires
terminal control. Cancellation and cleanup are executable operations, not physical
handle destruction. Use `setLimits` to select input, working and output budgets.

Native consumers import `world.Session`, `world.Prepared`, `world.Resident`, and
`world.invocation`. Production builds import only Boundary's pure data module.

## Build, package and command line

```sh
zig build build-kernel build-runtime
node zig-out/runtime/bin/world.mjs --help
node zig-out/runtime/bin/world.mjs invoke --kernel zig-out/runtime/world-kernel.wasm --sha256 EXPECTED_SHA256 --input command.pki3 > outcome.pko3
```

The CLI reads regular files, rejects observed changes, and writes canonical PKO3
bytes to stdout. The input is a complete PKI3 command, including image, initial
arguments or checkpoint, reply/cancellation/yield control, and optional quantum.
`build-runtime` creates a standalone package under `zig-out/runtime` without
constructing Boundary's authoring compiler. It does not publish a package.

```sh
zig build check
```

Native consumers use the public `world` module and the package selected by
`build.zig.zon`. An explicit `-Dboundary-source=/absolute/source` override is
captured by Zig and admitted against the selected package hash; the native build
uses `tar` to unpack that authenticated snapshot for compilation. No interpreter,
JS/WASM archive or script-generated metadata is a native prerequisite.

`check-native` and `check-storage` use shared native build roots. `check-source`
compares 42 source examples with the independent higher-order oracle and actual
native/WASM execution. The optional JS checks cover canonical bytes, handles,
capacity/retry behavior, package/CLI consumption and a real Chromium Worker.
Repeated measurement/transfer campaigns and the Python/Wasmtime dependency are
retired. The old `runtime prepare` producer is replaced by the ordinary Zig
package build and existing qualification roots.

## State and effects

BPI3 contains the closed executable Program; PST3 contains complete portable
execution. Fresh and resident operations publish only after admission and output
encoding succeed. Physical failures leave the prior authoritative input reusable.
Quanta bound internal transitions without changing authored results or effect order.
An unbounded invocation may diverge if the authored program diverges.

A cancelled pending cleanup retains its control and receives a newly bound request.
The environment may re-encode an already acquired typed result against that request;
World does not provide external rollback or global exactly-once effects.

Stable delivery and its compatibility limits are described in
[runtime bundles](docs/runtime-bundles.md). Agent applications retain their own
migration and qualification requirements.

See [verification](docs/verification.md) for the current coverage and the
remaining migration boundaries.

Source builds and existing v1 authenticated acquisition/verification are documented in [runtime bundles](docs/runtime-bundles.md).
