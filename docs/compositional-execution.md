# Compositional execution: World status

This is an incomplete part of the accepted Boundary 3 / World 6 / Agent successor.
The complete specification, including draft publication and serial review closeout,
remains the goal. No merge, release or application data operation has occurred.

World starts at `d075169a4805d999ceba4c37b3e1c925b78c3bf9` on the dedicated
`feat/compositional-execution` branch. Validation uses the separate Boundary
successor worktree at `f3236bfc2e364a95def9235e52ad9af89d18f6d6`, Zig 0.16.0,
and Node 26.8.2. The normal dependency pin remains the predecessor until cutover.

## Private activation slots

`src/interpreter_v2/activation_slots.zig` stores value descriptors in indexed
16-slot pages under a radix directory. Reads take a path bounded by machine word
width, not the number of earlier handlers. Existing unique paths update in place.
Shared paths copy only touched pages/directories; new storage is prepared before
the authoritative root changes. Directory growth never copies a whole slot array.

Forked views retain binding versions. They do not clone referents: an actually
outer mutable cell remains shared. Branch-local region/cell cloning must remain
the evaluator's separate semantic operation. Private reference counts, addresses,
generations and instance keys are not portable State or Program identity.

Handles check store instance, generation and active state. Iterators additionally
reject mutation after traversal starts and enumerate only initialized bindings in
slot order. Instance-counter exhaustion fails closed; its atomic uses the host word
size so the wasm32 baseline requires no 64-bit atomic support.

Tentative views can be discarded or committed without changing retained entry
views. Point updates and survivor compaction preserve the old root on allocation
failure. This is a component guarantee, not yet a complete Session transaction:
the evaluator's mutable object graph, control, pending response and output buffers
must participate in the final commit protocol as well.

`retainOnly` right-sizes a small survivor. It is not an implementation of ordinary
continuation capture or a per-boundary full-environment copy. The evaluator must
use changed liveness and required-disposition facts to clear dead slots; it must
not confuse memory reclamation with semantic finalization. Views and this store
have native owner lifetimes; all handles expire when their store is destroyed.

## Shared value evaluator

The existing aggregate/blob implementation reads either ordinary argument arrays
or stable slots through `operands.zig`. It now needs only schema records, not a
predecessor Program. Sparse slot tests execute real product, projection and blob
operations with independent expected bytes. No second value evaluator was added.
The current control interpreter still uses predecessor block interfaces.

## Evidence and limits

The growing 1/8/64/128/256/4096-binding tests establish each value without copying
earlier value descriptors. Retained loop versions and reentrant storage forks
remain isolated. A 4,096-slot population shrinks to one live page and at most two
directories for one surviving binding, with reserved storage under one eighth of
the original. Capacity accounting includes node bytes and reserved handle tables;
payload-graph storage and allocator overhead are separate.

Tests also cover stale/foreign handles, iterator invalidation, tentative commit
and rollback, ordered enumeration under different allocation histories, shared
outer cells, deterministic allocation-failure sweeps, and 600 mixed lifecycle
steps against an independent flat-array model. These are storage witnesses, not
proof of complete multi-shot or portable checkpoint execution.

```sh
zig build check-v2-native check-activation-storage-wasm \
  -Dboundary-v2-source=/absolute/path/to/boundary-compositional-execution \
  --global-cache-dir .cache/activation-global --summary all
zig build check-v2-native -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe \
  -Dboundary-v2-source=/absolute/path/to/boundary-compositional-execution \

zig build check-v2-source check-v2-wasm \
  -Dboundary-v2-source=/absolute/path/to/boundary-compositional-execution \
  --global-cache-dir .cache/activation-global --summary all
```

The isolated storage probe executes in an import-free wasm32 module with unshared
memory and an explicit maximum. It is a test probe, not World kernel ABI 3. Existing
source agreement and native/WASM transfer regressions pass, including handlers,
regions, cleanup, compact collections and 10,000 tail calls. Those are predecessor
regression results and do not establish successor portability.

No full-path latency improvement is claimed. The existing `NEG-000012` exclusion
still covers its exact old continuation-view/edge-projection implementation.
The definition-bound route check found no applicable exclusion for stable-slot
storage; no negative-evidence record was changed. The new mechanism still owes
the specification's measured complete-path comparison.

## Next required work

Connect stable control and lexical custody to these slots in the production
evaluator, complete borrowed-context admission, and run the M1 staged-source
witnesses. Prepared lifetime, whole-Session transactions, quanta, BPI3/PST3/current
protocols, ABI 3, browser/server transfer, Agent migration, component linking,
performance acceptance, legacy retirement and the linked draft PRs remain open.
